# HTML is the foundation and structure.
# CSS is the paint and the decorations for the appearances

    3 different ways to apply CSS into our document
        External
        Internal
        Inline
        
    CSS selectors
        Element selector = select all of the element of that.
                         = can be used only for that element.
            -> This will implement inheritance throughtout the page.
                Example: body element (only one body element per page)
                        or p {}  when declared, it will changed all of the <p> tag in the html.
            
        Class selector = Can be used more than once.
                       = More specific
            -> It starts with a period .
                Example:
                    .gray {

                    }
            -> To use the class selector to the html, you need to invoke it on the class (<p id="" class="color">)
            
        ID selector = Can be used only once and unique.
                    = It is not a good practice to use ID selector inside css
            -> It starts with a pound sign #
                Example:
                    #second {
                        font-style: italic;
                    }
            -> To use the ID selector to the html, you need to invoke it on the id <p id="idSelectorName" class="">


    Inheritance = That is where another elements inherit another element's peroperty or settings, the latest code will bypass the older code.
            -> Do not repeat yourself (DRY)


    Colors = Just use the hex # fer easy UI gradients

    Units and sizes = Pixel "px" was the commonly used.
            -> 16px was the default text of browser.
            -> rem was the typical unit used for font size.
            -> When using %, you need to remember that it is relative to the parent.
                Example: 
                    <header> with width 50%
                        <h1> with 50% -> this will only 25% of the screen.
                
    CSS Box Model = to manipulate the layout of each of the content.
                margin
                    border
                        padding
                            content         

    Typography = This is the font manipulation.
               = This is the way that the text is arranged and presented.

            -> text-align: (left/right/center/justify) = positioning
            -> text-decorations: (line-through/underline/overline/none) = with line
            -> text-transform: (capitalize/lowercase/uppercase) - letter manipulation
            -> text-indent: (2em) = indention of the first line.
            -> line-height: (1.5) = line space
            -> letter-spacing: () = letter space
            -> word-spacing: () = word space
            -> font-size: () = size of font
            -> font-weight: (bold?) = bold setting
            ->font-style: (italic/oblique) = italic settings
            -> font-family: () = 

    CSS links = basically you need to just set the following:
            -> text decorations, default color and pointer
            -> a:visited {}
            -> a:hover, a:focus {}
            -> a:active {}

    Ordered lists = 
            -> list-style-type: (lower-alpha/decimal/upper-roman) = setting the list appearances.
            -> list-style: square url('../img/checkmark.png') inside; = adding custom png
                ul li:nth-child(odd/2/even) { /* change the second list item */
                    color: red;
                }

    Display =
            -> Block level = stacks of boxes with 100percent width and it stacks on top of each other
                Example:
                    <h1>, <p>
            -> Inline level = only occupies thatwhat their content needs
                Example:
                    <a>





## Note -
            - Starts with css reset.
                * {
                margin 0;
                padding 0;
                box-sizing: border-box;
                }
            - Order of external, internal and inline CSS
            - Avoid inline CSS, better use external CSS.
            - You can group selectors example h1, h2, h3 {color: blue;}
            - You can verify/check css element on chrome dev tools. chrome > rightclick > inspect > styles > elements
            - Better to use html {} for setting the parent element instead of body {}
            - Only px and rem for the unit size. rem for font size.
            - use em on margin and padding.
            - You shouldnt set a font size on the root element.
            - When on dev tools, if you hover, the orange is the margin and the green is the padding.
            - for font family - it is common to use roboto or sans serif, monospace and fantasy
            - when using font, it is better not to use external link such as google font for it takes more to load, if you need to use google font better use import inside the css.
            - the order of hyperlink settings
                a {}
                    a:visited {}
                        a:hover, a:focus {}
                            a:active {}
                -:> text opacity is the common application of sudo class           

           - using sudo with : and ::
                example: 
                        ul li:nith-child() {} = 
                        ::marker = This is the part that you can add svg and font awesome for markers.



## CSS Anatomy/Order of things

    >> Always starts at the Top.
        *{}
            body{}
                header{}
                    nav{}
                        h2{}
                            ul{}
                                li{}

                main{}
                    article{}
                footer{}



    >>  This is how the css syntax.
        p {
            color: red
        }

        Where p is the selector
        color is the property
        red is the property value
        color: red; is the declaration.
