# HTML is the foundation and structure.
# CSS is the paint and the decorations for the appearances

    3 different ways to apply CSS into our document
        External
        Internal
        Inline
        
    CSS selectors
        Element selector = select all of the element of that.
                         = can be used only for that element.
            -> This will implement inheritance throughtout the page.
                Example: body element (only one body element per page)
                        or p {}  when declared, it will changed all of the <p> tag in the html.
            
        Class selector = Can be used more than once.
                       = More specific
            -> It starts with a period .
                Example:
                    .gray {

                    }
            -> To use the class selector to the html, you need to invoke it on the class (<p id="" class="color">)
            
        ID selector = Can be used only once and unique.
                    = It is not a good practice to use ID selector inside css
            -> It starts with a pound sign #
                Example:
                    #second {
                        font-style: italic;
                    }
            -> To use the ID selector to the html, you need to invoke it on the id <p id="idSelectorName" class="">


    Inheritance = That is where another elements inherit another element's peroperty or settings, the latest code will bypass the older code.
            -> Do not repeat yourself (DRY)





## Note - Starts with css reset.
            - Order of external, internal and inline CSS
            - Avoid inline CSS, better use external CSS.
            - You can group selectors example h1, h2, h3 {color: blue;}
            - You can verify/check css element on chrome dev tools. chrome > rightclick > inspect > styles > elements
            - Better to use html {} for setting the parent element instead of body {}

## CSS Anatomy/Order of things

        p {
            color: red
        }

        Where p is the selector
        color is the property
        red is the property value
        color: red; is the declaration.
